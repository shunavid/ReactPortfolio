        <p>
          From an early age, Iâ€™ve always been deeply interested in computing and
          completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
          <br /> I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how
          computers worked, why they worked, and what else they could do.
          <br /> Through the setting up of my own business and its subsequent
          running, I have learned many things. These include how to balance
          tasks effectively, how critical teamwork can be, and how to delegate
          tasks to get the job done quickly and efficiently.
          <br /> As well as spending time both studying, working and helping
          others to run the business I understand the importance of having time
          to relax.
          <br />
          The hobbies that I try to make time for are playing volleyball,
          football and also playing chess.
